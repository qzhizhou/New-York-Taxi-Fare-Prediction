# New-York-Taxi-Fare-Prediction

This is a project to predict the fare amount for a taxi ride in New York City given the pick-up and drop-off locations.

## Brief Introduction:

We have implemented four ways to solve this problem, using different models including Linear Regression, Neural Network, Gradiant Boost, Radom Forest.

## How to run programs:

First please go to https://www.kaggle.com/c/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction/data to download the dataset into 'src' folder.

```
git clone https://github.com/qzhizhou/New-York-Taxi-Fare-Prediction.git
cd New-York-Taxi-Fare-Prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd src
jupyter notebook
```

Then you may run navigate each program and run them using the notebook.
